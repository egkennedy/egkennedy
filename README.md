- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @egkennedy
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a graduate student at UC Davis in Prof. Tessa Hill's Ocean Climate Lab. I'm studying coastal ocean acidification and hypoxia and am particularly interested in mapping the high-resolution spatial and temporal variability in coastal chemistry. I am also interested in developing management-relevent indices or metrics for ocean chemistry that can be used in risk evaluation, fisheries management, or coastal planning. Currently, my main research projects are a large-scale synthesis of ocean acidification and hypoxia data in the California Current and a model-based study examining the impact of ocean acidification stress on Bering Sea king crab distributions.
