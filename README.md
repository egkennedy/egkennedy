- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @egkennedy
- ðŸ‘€ I am a current post-doctoral student with the University of Alaska and a recent graduate of Prof. Tessa Hill's Ocean Climate Lab at UC Davis. I study coastal ocean acidification and hypoxia and am particularly interested in how mapping the high-resolution spatial and temporal variability in coastal chemistry can inform resource management decisions. I am also interested in developing management-relevent indices or metrics for ocean chemistry that can be used in risk evaluation, fisheries management, or coastal planning. 
- ðŸ“« I can be reached at egkennedy@alaska.edu.
